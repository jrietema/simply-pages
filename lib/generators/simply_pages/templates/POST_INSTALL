SimplyPages has been installed to your Rails application!

You can now update your app:

  1. run the migrations:
     rake db:migrate

  2. review and configure the initializer under
     config/initializers/simply_pages.rb

     For instance, define the navigation_types you'll want to have
     pages for:
     SimplyPages.navigation_types = [:main, :footer]

  3. configure public render routes for your pages
     Check config/routes.rb to make sure the SimplyPages public render
     route is not intercepted and fits your application's requirements.


SimplyPages provides the simply_pages_nav helper for generating page navigation, for instance
in your layout use:

<ul>
 <li><%= link_to 'Home', root_path, class: 'home' %></li>
 <%= simply_pages_nav :main %>
</ul>

The helper will accept alternate tag types (other than the default li) as argument.

Go to your app path and /simply_pages/pages to start creating content!
